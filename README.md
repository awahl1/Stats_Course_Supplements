Lecture Demonstrations in R for Statistics Course

This repo contains R code files and accompanying data files. They are part of a series of lecture demonstrations that I created for a course I developed and taught on frequentist statistics in the Artificial Intelligence Department at Radboud University in the Netherlands in the spring of 2017. These demonstrations outline how to perform different types of statistical analyses using R and ggplot. They serve as supplements to the material found in the textbook "Discovering Statistics Using R", by Andy Field (2012), which we used in the statistics course.

The Demo files are as follows:
Vectors_Factors_Demo.R (for use w/ Ch. 3)
Dataframes_Demo.R (for use w/ Ch. 3)
Covariance_and_Correlations.R (for use w/ Ch. 6)
MultiRegression_Poly_Interact_Demo.R (for use w/ Ch. 7)
T_test_Wilcoxon_Demo.R (for use w/ Ch. 9)
ANOVA_demo.R (for use w/ Ch. 10)
Complex_Predictors_Demo.R (draws on material from Ch.'s 7, 11, 12,  13, and 19)
